/** This declaration of a constant 'avengerId' will fail
because you need to initialize a constant when it is declared!
Browser will not explicitly point out that constants have to be initialized when declared.
Instead it will say:
"Module parse failed: Unexpected token (lineNumber:positionOfTheSemicolon)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type."*/
